Harith's Bootcamp portfolio

This is my bootcamp portfolio website. Although aesthetically it does not look like the mock website provided functionally it is the same. 

the link in the nav bar connect to the corresponding section of the website. 
There is a hero banner with a “catchy” slogan. 
The about me section is populated with an up-to-date picture of myself. 
The first section of work is larger and more prominent that the other section. As it is early in the course it links to my only deployed assignment to date. The other sections link to the same assignment but that’s easily updated as I deploy more and more assignments.
